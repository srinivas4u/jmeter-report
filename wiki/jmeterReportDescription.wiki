|| *jmeterReport-1.0.x.pl* || is a perl script to analyze the JMeter AggregateReport jtl output file and create an html for a complete report and analysis of the results.||


=Introduction=

This perl script take as input the JMeter AggregateReport.jtl file (made by JMeter Listner Aggregate Report) and create a nice html report.


= Report Features =

== 1 jmeter Test General Data Overview ==

 * Test Overview, Number of Request, Throughput Http Request (see: /images/screen-01.PNG)

 * Jmeter Error Summary (see: /images/screen-02.PNG)

 * Http Code Summary, Http Error Summary (see: /images/screen-03.PNG)


== 2 Http/Https Request Detail ==

(see: /images/screen-04.PNG)

=== For every http/https request report: ===
 * Number of request
 * Statistics (Time and size): min, avg, max,90%, Avg Throughput
 * Response time Graph (for every Http Code type) (see: /images/screen-13.PNG)
 * Recap Request statistics Time (Table and Graph) (see: /images/screen-14.PNG)
 * Recap Request statistics Size (Table and Graph) (see: /images/screen-15.PNG)

== 3 Graph Result ==
 * jmeter Request Activity (see:  /images/screen-05.PNG)
 * jmeter Thread Activity (see: /images/screen-06.PNG)
 * jmeter Http Request Elapsed (see: /images/screen-07.PNG)
 * jmeter Throughput-Elapsed-Latency-IdleTime (see: /images/screen-08.PNG)
 * jmeter Request Statistic Time(min,mean,90perc,max) (see: /images/screen-09.PNG)
 * jmeter Request Statistic Size(min,mean,90perc,max) (see: images/screen-11.PNG)

every graph show value (by pass over), do the zoom, show legend and let to show/hide the data line


== To do this, you have to: ==

*1) Download Flot library in order to have the graphs*
(http://code.google.com/p/flot/)

Flot is a pure Javascript plotting library for jQuery (relased under the term of MIT License).

*1.a) Add jquery.flot.orderBars.js to standard flot lib.*

*2) Enable and configure JMeter AggregateReport Listner on your JMeter test (see Appendix A)*

*3) Perform your test whith JMeter*

now you have AggregateReport.jtl of your JMeter test

*4) Run the script jmeterReport.pl*

see all the script option in Appendix B or run:

 ./jmeterReport-1.0.x.pl --help




== Files and directory structure: ==
{{{
  ./Report/
      README.txt                    
      jmeterReport-1.0.x.pl         (the perl script)
      ./example/jmTest.jmx          (example: test description)
      ./example/AggregateReport.jtl (example: test data)
      ./css/                        (styles)
      ./flot/                       (flot lib; download and put here the library and jquery.flot.orderBars.js)
}}}

Run:

*./jmeterReport-x-x-x.pl -a ./example/AggregateReport.jtl -e ./example/jmTest.jmx*

     This create:
{{{
         ./jmReport/                    (default report directory)
         ./jmReport/jmeterReport.html   (default report file)
         ./jmReport/graph/              (default html graph directory)
         ./jmReport/data/               (default data directory)
}}}

     Now you can view the result of your jmeter test in the report: jmeterReport.html


That's all.
